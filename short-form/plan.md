## Plan

## Intro (50 Words)

- Playing with my very young cousin, made incomprehensible babbling noises
- Reminded me of LLM responses in early training phases: complete
  gibberish.
- Made me question how humans learn language, and is it anything like
  LLMs?

## Language acquired in phases (120 Words)

- Consistent phases: reflexive vocalisation -> babbling -> words
- MLU (common quantitative measurement in child language studies)
  increases with time, with the earliest multi-word utterances all
  being gramatically predictable. Shows clear internal structure is being
  acquired (or is there, if you ask a nativist)
- Interestingly, spoken languages are acquired at the same rate as signed
  languages: **modality independence**
- Exception: time to arrive at one word stage. This is a physiological
  limitation, as evidenced by bilingual signing/speaking children)

## Receptive Language Ability (Children's language learning inputs)

- Physiology undeniably important with language learning, in production
  but also in perception.
- Children up to a year old are **universal phoneme detectors**
  (=distinguish sounds from any language).
- After \~12 months, lose sensitivity to uncommon sounds e.g. **/d/** (voiced alveolar plosive, English) vs **/dÌª/** (voiced dental plosive, Hindi)
- This tuning suggests that early exposure plays a formative role in
  shaping the auditory model of language.

## Nativism, Behaviourism, and LLMs

- Receptive Language Ability clearly has an impact on the kind of
  "training data" a child receives.
- A key debate in CLD is whether we learn language through this input data
  alone, or if we have an innate language ability
- Behaviourists claim that language is learned solely via reinforcement
- Nativists (famously, Chomsky) disagree, and argue that we have a  
  Language Acquisition Device. They may look to the _poverty of the
  stimulus_ to argue such a case.

- LLMs pose an interesting challenge

  - Suffer from same _poverty of the stimulus_ limitation, but seem to
    have acquired language excellently.
  - Training often _weakly supervised_, meaning that there is some
    human-labelled data, but mostly the LLM is just trained on pre-
    existing unlabelled data.
  - Learn structure as **embeddings** in high-dimensional vector spaces,
    not as grammar rules.
  - Could be used to motivate the more modern side of the nativism debate:
    is language learning just pattern recognition, or something more?

- Is this a meaningful comparison?

  - Probably not
  - You wouldn't study an aeroplane to understand how a bird flies.
  - No more than an interesting comparison: so many differences in memory,
    and trained on petabytes of data.

- Takeaway
  - LLMs and children are fundamentally different, and a comparison
    between their language learning is no more than an interesting thought
    experiment
