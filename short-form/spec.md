# Science Short Form Communication

> For this assignment, your task is to create a short piece communicating a
> concept from this course unit in a way that the general public can understand.
> The format is flexible. Science communication comes in many forms — comics,
> infographics, TikTok videos, tweet threads, blog posts, interviews, podcast
> segments, even interpretive dance — and you are free to choose your medium.
> The objective is to get an idea across clearly and accurately, in a way that
> is engaging and memorable.
> The topic you choose should come from Unit 1 or Unit 2, and should relate
> specifically to language. The scope of your content should be approximately
> equivalent to what would fit in a 500-word essay (though what that looks like
> will of course depend on the format you choose).
