Children spend their first two months crying and grunting (reflexive vocalisation) before moving on to cooing.</p> <p>Then, they babble, which is what I heard my cousin doing. After 12-14 months, children start to form words. As time continues, their mean length of utterance (a common quantitative measure in child linguistic studies) increases.</p> A (simplified) diagram showing the key stages of language acquisition. <p>In the two-word stage, children produce utterances in correct grammatical order, which suggests they have learned (or, perhaps, innately have) grammatical structure.</p> <p>Interestingly, these typical developmental milestones don't vary across language or mode. Signing children will learn to sign in the same recognisable phases as their speaking counterparts at the same rate (aside from at the the one-word stage).</p> Baby babbling in sign language (ASL). <p>Physiology clearly affects how quickly children can produce language.

Adults, in comparison, are not able to differentiate between some sounds in their non-native languages.</p> <p>A common example is the voiced alveolar plosive, /d/, vs the voiced dental plosive, /d\u032a/. The former is common in English, whereas the latter is not found in English but in Hindi.</p> A child and their caregiver about to undergo a head turn test. <p>Conditional head turn tests show that hearing English infants can differentiate the two sounds up till a year old. After that, no difference.</p> <p>This tuning suggests that the stimulus children have when acquiring language can vary wildly after a year. A key debate in CLD is whether children learn language only from this stimulus, or if there is some innate machinery that we all have which predisposes us to learn language.</p>"},{"location":"#nativism-behaviourism-and-llms","title":"Nativism, Behaviourism, and LLMs","text":"<p>Behaviourism was pioneered in psychology in a 1913 paper by John B. Watson. Behaviourists argue that the stimulus (language input) alone is responsible for children learning language. That is, we have no \"built-in\" understanding of the structure of language and only learn via reinforcement.</p> <p>Nativists like Chomsky argue that children must have innate grammar knowledge. They cite the poverty of the stimulus: language input lacks enough information to explain how children learn complex rules, especially since infants rarely hear ungrammatical sentences.</p> <p>LLMs pose an interesting question for Nativists: working with the same poor stimulus, LLMs are clearly excellent tools for manipulating language. LLMs are often trained in a weakly supervised way by exposure to massive text samples without labels or grammatical feedback.</p> Vector Embeddings: Taken from Towards AI. <p>Furthermore, LLMs represent semantics as embeddings in high-dimensional vector spaces, not as grammar rules as a Nativist may claim.
