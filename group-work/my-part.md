Today ill be arguing language isnt self-contained module hiding in the brain (like a hermit in a cave)

More like a social butterfly at a party � constantly mingling, influenced by the crowd and aware of context

Simple: imagine hearing an ambiguous sound like s or sh. Now imagine that looking at a face changes how you hear it. Not a trick � Strand and Johnson (1996) found.

People's social perception of gender influenced their basic sound categorization

That is language processing, shaped by visual and social cognition � not just sound alone

---

Or is it.... (play vsauce sound, vsauce face appearence\_)

Just because seeing a face changes the sound we hear, does this really mean
language isn't a self contained module?

What if, a **dedicated language module** processed the sound, and couldn't tell
the difference between the 's' and 'sh'?

Then, **a different module** processed the face!

Finally, a different module entirely **combines the results**, to change how you
hear the sound!

So, think more 'Chinese Whispers...' than social butterfly or the hermit in a
cave.

Now, what happens when the brain gets creative?

Children with early brain damage to so-called language areas like Broca�s or Wernicke�s often go on to develop language just fine � use different areas entirely

Some shift language to the left side some to the right, some even split it across both (Elsabbagh and Karmiloff-smith). That is neural plasticity in action � not a plug and play language module

Not so fast!!

Just because we can 'get by' without fully functioning Broca's or Wernike's
area, doesn't mean we aren't better off with them.

It's like leaving the house in the morning without a coffee or tea; can be done,
but just not as good!

[todo: find source] shows that people don't perform as well at language tasks
with damage to their Wernike or Broca's areas of the brain. Sometimes, people
don't recover at all leading to conditions like Broca's aphasia.

So, it may possible to get by without the "dedicated hardware" - we are **very**
good at pattern recognition.

But, the fact that we find it harder with damaged
Wernike/Brocas areas show that maybe its not as simple as it all seems....

And lets not forget the McGurk effect

Where your ears hear �ba�, your eyes see �ga� and your brain invents �da�

That is multisensory intergration

Language, here, is clearly not limited to just one sensory channel

Even more fascinating? Those weird �sine wave speech�
