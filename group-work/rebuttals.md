# Rebuttals

- Arguing against "_Language is best explained by integration with other
  cognitive systems_"

## Language processes are intertwined with social + visual cues/cognition

- Fodor states that the mind can be modelled as several isolated (encapsulated) processes; internal state of process A does not affect internal state of process B
- Fricative sounds show at least one example which seems to suggest otherwise:

  - Gender context _changes how people perceive sounds_

- There are explanations for this which fit with the _isolated processes_ model

### Post Perceptual Judgement

- Process are isolated, but the **output** of one process could be used as the
  **input** to another (Fodor 1983).

  - Processes don't share resources or internal state (criteria given in
    slides)

- _"Speech parsing"_ process struggles to determine which sound (S or Sh) in
  both cases
- Added context: a **different process** uses the ambiguous result from _"Speech
  parsing"_ to decide a more likely result (e.g. using speaker's gender)

- Idea supported by literature: Ganong effect (lexical context biases phoneme
perception); argued to reflect a **post-perceptual decision**, not feedback
altering the phoneme identification process itself (Norris, McQueen, & Cutler, 2000; McQueen, Jesse, & Mitterer, 2023)
<!-- XXX: Check citaion-->

- Pylyshyn (1999) argues that many cases of cognitive penetration are actually
  post-perceptual judgement.

## Language is sensitive to experience/plasticity

- Plasticity and the ability to recover from brain injury doesn't mean the
  damaged areas weren't initially specialised for language!
- The fact that initial language delays are often greater following left-hemisphere
  lesions, even if significant recovery occurs later, supports the idea of an initial
  left-hemisphere advantage or bias

- Reorganisation isn't free: affected children sometimes showing slightly
  lower overall cognitive/language performance (lower end of normal range) - Suggests
  that the adaptation is not "_as good as_" the specialised centres -

## Language uses general cognitive resources

- McGurk effect seems to show IPC; again, it could be several chained distinct
  processes, or it could be that the speech processing "_module_" is **inherently
  multimodal**. This wouldn't contradict the model, so the McGurk effect doesn't
  provide any evidence either-which way.

- Fodor specifically said that system could be encapsulated relative to central
  cognition but unencapsulated relative to another system.

- For the case of the Sine Wave example, the same objection can be raised as
  with post perceptual judgement: auditory context can affect **other processes**
  which are in the _same chain_ as the auditory perception.
  - https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5641286/
- Module itself might still process input automatically based on physical
  characteristics: result might become meaningful when other modules process it
  with the context (e.g. knowing that it resembles speech)

## Developmental disorders show overlapping cognitive mechanisms

- In the case of, SLI/DLD

  - Not all language suffers equally; vocabulary often very well formed, but
    those with the condition often struggle with grammar (e.g -ed for past
    participles)
    - https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-child-language/article/abs/relationship-between-working-memory-and-complex-syntax-in-children-with-developmental-language-disorder/D99A78C1682BFBCB42277E914AB5FCD2#
  - If it were a general memory problem, wouldn't vocabulary be just as bad?
  - There exists G-SLI: groups where **only** grammar is affected by SLI.
    - https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15668097/

- With Williams Syndrome
  - "Opposite of SLI"
    - https://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/id/eprint/14751/1/269434_vol1.pdf
  - Oversimplification to say that patients with WS have no language impairment
    - Development shows delays and specific weaknesses (e.g. spatial language,
      naming) (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266908275_Williams_Syndrome_Dissociation_and_Mental_Structure)
  - Uneven profile suggests a fine-grained "modular" structure; not enough to
    prove modularity on its own, but at the same time not evidence to dismiss
    it.

## Priming effects show dynamic interpretive systems

- **Attentional Gating**
  - Processes are allowed to be interlinked s.th. one's output can be used as
    another's input.
  - _Attention Gating_ (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/334393693_Attention_and_encapsulation): another process could _modulate the flow of information to different processing systems_
  - Pylyshyn's (1999) supports this possibility: argues that attention may
    operate **pre-perceptually**.
