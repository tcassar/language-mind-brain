Today ill be arguing language isnt self-contained module hiding in the brain (like a hermit in a cave)

More like a social butterfly at a party � constantly mingling, influenced by the crowd and aware of context

Simple: imagine hearing an ambiguous sound like s or sh. Now imagine that looking at a face changes how you hear it. Not a trick � Strand and Johnson (1996) found.

People's social perception of gender influenced their basic sound categorization

That is language processing, shaped by visual and social cognition � not just sound alone

Break for rebuttal

TODO for me

Now, what happens when the brain gets creative?

Children with early brain damage to so-called language areas like Broca�s or Wernicke�s often go on to develop language just fine � use different areas entirely

Some shift language to the left side some to the right, some even split it across both (Elsabbagh and Karmiloff-smith). That is neural plasticity in action � not a plug and play language module

And lets not forget the McGurk effect

Where your ears hear �ba�, your eyes see �ga� and your brain invents �da�

That is multisensory intergration

Language, here, is clearly not limited to just one sensory channel

leave it on cool example

Even more fascinating? Those weird �sine wave speech�
