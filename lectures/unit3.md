# Production and Perception

## Speech Production

- Competence: grammar structures we know
- Performance: how well do we do what were trying to do
- Chomsky said this is a real difference: other linguists disagree
- => not necessarily real distinction, but useful

### Aspects of Linguistic Planning

- Meaning: what are you trying to explain
- Syntactic structure (structure links to meaning)
- Lexicon: fill structure with words (links structure to words); content
  vs stop words;
- Morphology
- Phonology: how to say the things
- Phonetics: physically saying the thing

### Errors:

- **Memory errors** - what was I saying?
- **Disfluencies** -

- Agreement attraction (error)

  - Agreement between nouns and verbs e.g. plural noun uses they/them conj
  - An error: there might be a **lure noun** which muddles things (esp.
    if it's close to the verb)

- Tip of the tongue phenomenon

  - Partial failure
  - Error in lexical access: just cant remember the word!
    - Shows that words and meanings are decoupled
  - Normally have first sound and an idea of number of syllables in word:
    interesting as it shows something about how words are indexed

- Spoonerisms

  - Swapping sounds of words; first set of constonants before a vowel
  - _You hissed my mistory lecture_

- Tongue-twisters optimised for creating errors in articulatory instructions;
  often use very similar sounds

  - Constonants trip up constonants, vowels trip up vowels; not between the

- Factors affecting error rate

  - Fatigue
  - Intoxication
  - Nervousness
  - Multitasking

- Restrictions and patterns on errors:
  - Happen in predictable ways
  - (unless exceptional) still work within the soundscape of your
    language
  - show that it is not as simple as competence vs performance

## Speech Production

- Decoding the signal:


---

- Spotted in the wild vs LLMs
  - when constructing a sentence, there is a difference between content
    words and smaller filler words; NLP called stop words, and ignored
    by all sorts of processors e.g. google.
    Effectively the reverse of the process outlined here
  - Form and meaning are not coupled together (embeddings)
