# Language and Thought

- How does language shape thought
    - Edward Sapir Hypothesis

- Lingusitic determinism: language determines thought
- Universalism: human cognition is universal

- Lingusitic relativity
    - Language doesn't determine, but influences

- Confound when answering the question
    - Language and culture often intersect
    - Language influences culture or vice versa?

- Also, what is thought?
    - Represent information in mind
    - Not everyone has inner monologue; instead _visual_ or _sensory_; cognitive
      prime

## Cognitive Determinism

- Debunking linguistic determinism
    - Whorf: fire cause inspection
    - _"Empty"_ was the problem: workers used the words empty, didn't have the
      words to convey the fact that they were full of fumes

    - Silly: untranslatable words: **Kummerspeck**: weight gain via
      sadness-induced overeating
    - Not necessarily that words aren't representable: just the case that
      languages have a different level of verbosity

    - **1984** - not having a specific word doesn't mean you cannot conceive of
      the concept

### So why is determinism popular?

- Hopi time controversy
    - Whorf: hopi has no concept of time in their language
    - Lots of ways that languages can refer to time
        - Hopi: _time_ has no specific translation, but the grammar
          encodes ways to represent time

#### Assimilation in the US

- Assimilation policy
    - Richard Henry Pratt: racism bloke
    - Said indigineous cultures/languages were bad and they should be "saved"
      and "civilised".

- Dawes act: changed stewardship of land on reservations => western individual
  model
- Compulsory indian education act: children forcibly educated off-reservation

- Snyder act: not "indigineous" but instead "American" and fell under US gov
  jurisdiction.

- Termination policy

- 1978: parents could not send parents to their schools

- Most above targeted towards **education** as opposed to anything else
- Wanted to "eradicate indigineous" practices: hair was cut, forced to speak
  English/French instead of their own language
- Schools were mostly about forced labour and cultural genocide

### Relating to Hopi Time Controversy
- Comments about Hopi not having a concept of time not made in vacuum
    - Happened at a time where cultural context was assimilationist

- "Timeless Hopi" reinforces -ve stereotypes about indigineous cultures
- Used language as "in-group/out-group" idea: we are **fundamentally different**
  from them on a human level

## Lingustic Relativity
- **Grammatical Gender**
    - Classification of nouns
    - (languages with up to 16 categorisations)

- Gramatical gender shown to have an impact on how speakers perceive objects
    - Bridges: feminine in Spanish, masculine in German
    - Found that spanish speakers used more feminine (english equivalent words)
      to describe bridges and vice versa
    - (Caveat: english equivalents are more associated with gendered traits:
    different cultural context, what is "masculine" in English may not be in
    another language)

- Basic colour terms (e.g. rainbow)
    - Different languages have different colour terms
    - Find that languages "get" colours in very similar patterns
    - e.g. if 2 colours, white and black... get "blue" quite late on

- How easy is it to tell the difference between two colours
    - Difference on the boundary of a category is easier to see than differences
      within a category

- => Categories that languages have influences how people categorise things

## Sapir
- Real world is socially constructed, done through language
- Social constructivism: things we experience are socially constructed
    - E.g. money: social construct, but is real and has real consequences.

- Category of sex is socially constructed
    - No _lab test_ that can tell you if someone is male or female as these are
      not rigorously defined.
    - Have always been non-binary genders etc

- Only having two gendered entities in a language doesn't mean it is impossible
  to conceive of anyone else, but it does improve recognition

- Terms for marginalised groups change frequently:
    - Word used to describe a group takes on negative attitudes towards the
      group
    - New word is chosen s.th. it doesn't have a connection with the negative
    attitudes
    - cycle repeats...
