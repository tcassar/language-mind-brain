# Neurodiversity

## Autism
- Sensory perception and processing

- Neurotypical: person who **processes information** typically

- Low/High Functioning
    - Not helpful as only tests the interface with the neurotypical world

- ~~Severity~~ degree
- Asperger's: created by a Nazi, Nazi's weren't keen on neurodiverse things

- Mental age: silly metric
    - What does that mean
    - Used as a way to remove agency

- Verbal vs Non-Verbal also not helpful
    - Instead, speaking vs non-speaking
    - Augmentative vs alternative communication

## Auditory Scene Analysis

- We get a single complex sound wave
    - How does our brain autoFFT?

- Autistic people
    - Tend to be more detail-oriented with sensory processing
    - e.g. noticing fine details in vocal pitch etc.
        - Explains (to an extent) sensory overload I guess?

- ASA modulated by attention
    - Paying attention => possible to pick up on finer details

- ADHD: difficulties with selective attention

## Language and Autism

- **Lots** of problems with autism research
